    <!-- how to italisize text in html : we can use <i> or <em> (emphasis) both of them do the same job visually but -->
    <i>this is using i tag</i>
    <em>thi is using em tag</em>
    <!-- the difference lies b/w when should we use them one is used to stress on a text and other to represent some of the differently written text -->
    <!-- same goes for the <strong> and <b> tag : strong contains the meaning that the enclosed text is to be given importance whereas the b tag is just about the style of the text like the i tag . Hence we should always use the strong and em tags rather than i and b tag because they give more meaning to the text -->
